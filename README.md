# 📝 Repo Description

This repository contains a collection of algorithm and data structure exercises written in Python. The assignments are part of my coursework on algorithmic problem solving, with a strong focus on efficiency, clarity, and proper documentation.

The exercises cover topics such as:

- ✅ Sliding window algorithms
-  ✅ Dynamic programming (e.g., minimum perfect squares problem)
- ✅ Binary search techniques in large search spaces
- ✅ Grid-based search strategies
- ✅ Generating mirrored numbers with mathematical constraints

All solutions respect the performance requirements, handling large inputs efficiently where needed.

## 💡 Why this repo?

This project serves as both a personal portfolio and a technical reference for common algorithmic problems.
